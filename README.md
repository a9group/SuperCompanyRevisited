# Persona-Driven GPT Generation

Welcome to the Persona-Driven GPT Generation project! This repository is designed to help you generate detailed personas and their respective areas of responsibility within a corporate structure. These personas are tailored for use with GPTs (Generative Pre-trained Transformers), equipped with custom knowledge files and actions that suit their areas of expertise.

## Project Overview

This project leverages the power of GPT-4 to automate the creation and organization of corporate personas, providing them with detailed knowledge files and specific actions to enhance their effectiveness. Each persona is aligned with corporate goals, ensuring a cohesive and strategic approach to business development and operational efficiency.

### Key Features

- **Automated Persona Generation**: Generate detailed personas with specific responsibilities and knowledge areas.
- **Custom Knowledge Files**: Equip each persona with tailored knowledge files to enhance their GPT capabilities.
- **Organizational Alignment**: Align personas with corporate goals and principles, ensuring strategic consistency.
- **Continuous Improvement Focus**: Incorporate Six Sigma DMAIC principles to emphasize continuous improvement and operational excellence.
- **Visual Representations**: Create detailed Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAGs) to visualize persona interactions and strategic planning phases.

## Project Structure

The repository is organized as follows:

- **CSV Files**: Contains data files (`persona_table.csv`, `interaction_details.csv`, `rasci_table.csv`) used for persona generation and visualization.
- **Python Scripts**: Scripts to read data, generate personas, create directories, and populate them with detailed prompts.
- **Visualization**: `grapher.py` creates DAGs from the CSV files to highlight continuous improvement and persona interactions.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed:

- Python 3.x
- Pandas
- NetworkX
- Matplotlib
- NumPy

Install the required packages using pip:

```bash
pip install pandas networkx matplotlib numpy
```

### Running the Scripts

1. **Prepare Your Data**: Ensure your CSV files (`persona_table.csv`, `interaction_details.csv`, `rasci_table.csv`) are correctly formatted and located in the same directory as your scripts.

2. **Generate Personas**: Run the prompt builder to generate detailed personas and populate the directories:

   ```bash
   python simple_promptbuilder.py
   ```

3. **Visualize Planning Phases**: Run the grapher script to create and display the DAG for strategic planning and review phases:

   ```bash
   python grapher.py
   ```

## Project Files

### `persona_table.csv`

Defines the basic details of each persona, including their roles, responsibilities, and core values.

### `interaction_details.csv`

Details the interactions between personas, highlighting key points of collaboration and specific actions.

### `rasci_table.csv`

Defines RASCI responsibilities for core workflow steps.

### `simple_promptbuilder.py`

Lightweight script to generate personas and populate their prompts and RASCI details.

### `grapher.py`

Creates a DAG showing persona interactions and DMAIC phases, emphasizing continuous improvement principles.
